# Outline:
- An image conversion tool built using Dart using an open-source CLI package I had previously built, which can be found [here](https://github.com/akashvshroff/CLI_Wizard_Tool). The project allows users to convert any picture in their current working directory from PNG to JPEG or JPG and vice-versa using the [image package](https://pub.dev/packages/image). A detailed description of the build lies below. 

# Purpose:
- Before I could properly understand Flutter and dive headfirst into the world of app development, I wanted to better understand Dart and therefore be able to fully leverage its characteristics to build cleaner and more efficient apps. While I have in-depth experience with Python, my rudimentary Java knowledge did not provide an apt introduction to a C-style typed language like Dart and therefore I wanted to learn more about Dart through these sort of projects. 
- This project was covered in the [Flutter and Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/dart-and-flutter-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/lecture/10645864?components=buy_button%2Cdiscount_expiration%2Cgift_this_course%2Cpurchase%2Cdeal_badge%2Credeem_coupon#overview) Udemy Course and through it I was able to understand some of the more nuanced facets of Object Oriented Programming and Dart. 
- While relatively easy, the build was very engaging as I tried relying on the Dart standard library to build a clean CLI and understood useful concepts such as interacting with the file system, decoding and encoding images as well as synchronous vs asynchronous code.
